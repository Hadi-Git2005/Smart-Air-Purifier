# Smart Air Purifier with Dual Activated Carbon Filters

## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution inside households is a growing concern, especially in urban environments. Commercial air purifiers are often expensive and require frequent manual filter replacement.  
This project presents a **low-cost smart air purifier** that uses **activated carbon filters** and an **air quality sensor** to automatically maintain effective air purification.

The system intelligently switches between a **main filter** and a **sub (backup) filter** when the primary filter becomes saturated, ensuring continuous air purification with minimal user intervention.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reduce indoor air pollution using **activated carbon filtration**
- Provide a **low-cost solution** suitable for household use
- Automatically detect filter saturation using **air quality sensing**
- Eliminate manual filter replacement through **automatic filter switching**

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. A **propeller (fan)** draws polluted air into the system.
2. Air passes through the **main activated carbon filter**, removing pollutants.
3. An **air quality sensor** continuously monitors the quality of the filtered air.
4. When the air quality drops below a predefined threshold, the system detects **filter saturation**.
5. A **motor-driven mechanical mechanism** lowers the saturated main filter and lifts the **sub filter** into operation.
6. Air purification continues seamlessly using the sub filter until maintenance is performed.
